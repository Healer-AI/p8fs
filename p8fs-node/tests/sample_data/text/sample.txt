This is a sample text file for testing the text content provider.

It contains multiple paragraphs with various types of content including:
- Lists
- Headers
- Code snippets

## Section Header

Here's another paragraph with some inline code: `print("Hello, World!")`.

### Subsection

The text provider should handle this content correctly and extract meaningful chunks for processing.

```python
def example_function():
    return "This is a code block"
```

Final paragraph with conclusion text.
