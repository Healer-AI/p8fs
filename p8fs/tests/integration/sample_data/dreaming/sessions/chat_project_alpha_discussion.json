SLA Commitments**:\n- Acme is requesting 99.9% uptime from day one\n- This is aggressive given current infrastructure\n- Solution: Phased approach (99.5% months 1-3, then 99.9% months 4-12)\n- Requires significant infrastructure investment (multi-AZ, automated failover)\n\n**2. Timeline Pressure**:\n- Acme wants to launch by end of Q1 2025\n- Building in redundancy for 99.9% SLA adds 4-6 weeks\n- May conflict with other priorities (microservices migration)\n\n**3. Performance Requirements**:\n- P95 latency < 300ms under load\n- 5,000 requests/second sustained throughput\n- Vector search across millions of documents in < 2 seconds\n- Requires thorough load testing before production\n\n**4. Integration Complexity**:\n- Okta SSO integration required\n- Existing document corpus migration\n- Custom features may be needed\n\n**5. Financial Considerations**:\n- $50K/month base fee\n- Overage charges for high usage\n- Need to ensure infrastructure costs don't eat into margins\n\n**Key Contacts**: David Wilson (CTO) and Lisa Martinez (VP Engineering) at Acme Corp.\n\n**Next Steps**: Follow-up call scheduled to finalize SLA terms and timeline.",

Project Alpha could be one of the first services extracted\n2. New architecture could support better scaling for Acme's needs\n3. Separation of concerns helps meet SLA requirements\n4. Independent deployment of Project Alpha components\n\n**Risks**:\n1. **Resource Conflict**: Team bandwidth split between two major initiatives\n2. **Architecture Decisions**: Commit to monolith now or design for services?\n3. **Timeline Impact**: Migration could delay Project Alpha delivery\n4. **Testing Complexity**: Need to test both architectures\n\n**Current Plan** (from Architecture Overview):\n- Phase 1 (Feb): Extract background processing\n- Phase 2 (Mar): Extract search functionality - **Overlaps with Project Alpha launch**\n- Phase 3 (Apr): Extract auth service\n- Phase 4 (May-Jun): Split core services\n\n**Team Consensus**:\n- Mike Johnson and Sarah Chen suggest starting with monolith for Project Alpha\n- Plan for microservices architecture but don't delay delivery\n- Use Project Alpha as a learning experience for the migration\n- Re-architect later if needed\n\n**Open Question**: Should Project Alpha be designed with service boundaries in mind even if deployed as monolith initially?",
