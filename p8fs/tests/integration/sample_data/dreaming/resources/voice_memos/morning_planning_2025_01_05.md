## Transcript

**[08:30]** Alright, let's plan out the day. I need to focus on Project Alpha this morning. The API design document is due to John Smith by end of week, so I should probably get that wrapped up today or tomorrow at the latest.

**[08:32]** Feeling pretty good actually, slept well last night. Coffee is helping. I'm optimistic about getting through this API spec - I've been thinking about the authentication flow and I think I have a clean solution now.

**[08:35]** So priorities for today:
1. Finish API authentication section - about 2 hours of work
2. Review the contract from Acme Corp that came in yesterday - Jane Doe from legal wants my technical review
3. Team standup at 2 PM
4. Maybe start looking at the microservices migration plan if I have time

**[08:40]** Project Alpha is really coming together. Sarah Chen and I had a great brainstorming session last week about the architecture. I think we're aligned on the approach now. Using OAuth 2.1 with PKCE for the mobile clients, standard bearer tokens for the web app.

**[08:42]** Need to remember to ping the Acme Corp team about their timeline. They mentioned wanting to move fast, but I haven't heard back from their CTO since our last call. That contract review is important - it's a big deal for the company.

**[08:45]** Also should check in with the team on the Q1 goals. We're tracking okay but I'm a bit worried about the microservices migration timeline. That's a big lift and we might need more resources.

**[END 09:15]** Good session. Feeling focused and ready to tackle the day.
