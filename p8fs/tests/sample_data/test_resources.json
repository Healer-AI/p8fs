    "content": "Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn from data. Deep learning, a subfield of ML, uses neural networks with multiple layers to learn hierarchical representations. Key concepts include supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. Applications range from computer vision and natural language processing to robotics and recommendation systems.",
