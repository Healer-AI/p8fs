  "name": "Code Review - Dashboard Component Refactoring",
  "content": "Jordan requested code review from Alex for dashboard refactor. Identified 450-line DataVisualization component as overly complex 'God component' handling data fetching, transformation, rendering, and state management. Alex suggested architectural improvements: extract data fetching into custom hook (useVisualizationData), move transformation logic to utility function, return loading/error states from hook. Jordan recognized the pattern and committed to refactoring before PR submission. Alex praised the chart library integration work that Sam helped with. Collaborative problem-solving with constructive feedback.",
