  "content": "Alex debugging rate limiter false positives. Discovered root cause: timestamp unit mismatch between Node.js (milliseconds) and Lua script (seconds), causing all requests to appear as if from 1970. Traced issue to line 12 of Lua script using os.time. Implemented fix by converting milliseconds to seconds. Ran both unit and integration tests successfully. Noted need for additional timezone handling test coverage. Deployed to staging for monitoring.",
