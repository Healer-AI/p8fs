  "name": "Solo Architecture Planning - Rate Limiting Design",
  "content": "Alex working through rate limiting architecture design via voice notes. Explored sliding window algorithm using Redis sorted sets for both per-user and global rate limits. Initially concerned about latency from dual Redis calls, then arrived at solution using Lua scripts for atomic execution. Also considered resilience patterns, deciding on circuit breaker with fail-open behavior when Redis is unavailable. Clear progression from problem definition through iteration to final design decision.",
