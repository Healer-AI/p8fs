  "name": "Lyric Writing - Track Nine 'Echoes'",
  "content": "Maya writing lyrics for track nine, working title 'Echoes', exploring theme of persistent memories and inability to let go. Developed opening line through iteration: 'Your voice still lingers in empty rooms, like smoke that won't dissolve.' Identified hook: 'chasing echoes'. Created contrasting second verse using concrete details rather than metaphors: coffee cups, playlists, deleted phone numbers remembered by heart. Bridge addressed emotional core: acknowledgment of being stuck and questioning desire to move on. Self-aware about emotional heaviness but committed to honesty. Tested lyrics against melody successfully. Established foundational structure for further development.",
