  "name": "Band Rehearsal - New Song Arrangement",
  "content": "Band rehearsal with Maya (vocals/piano), Devon (drums), and Riley (bass) working on new song arrangement. Established structure: piano and vocals start, drums enter at pre-chorus, bass doubling piano subtly from beginning. Iterative refinement: Devon adjusted timing on fill to be less rushed and more laid back. Riley dropped bass line down an octave on chorus for more weight and impact. Second full run-through achieved desired energy. Team decided to record scratch track while momentum is strong. Collaborative music-making with clear artistic direction from Maya and responsive adjustments from band members.",
