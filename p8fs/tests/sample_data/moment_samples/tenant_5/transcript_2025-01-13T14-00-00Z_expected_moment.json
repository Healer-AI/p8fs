  "name": "EVA Preparation Briefing - Antenna Repair Mission",
  "content": "Commander Chen leading EVA briefing for spacewalk mission to repair S-band antenna loose mounting bracket on Z1 truss segment. Crew assignments: Lieutenant Torres (primary repair), Flight Engineer Kim (tether management, documentation). Detailed timeline established: 0700 oxygen prebreathe protocol, 0800 depressurization, 0845 airlock exit, 30-meter translation along starboard handrails, 45-minute repair window, 1030 return. Technical procedures reviewed: four-bolt bracket removal with hardware containment preventing orbital debris, helmet cam documentation, replacement parts pre-staged. Backup plan authorized: full antenna removal for internal assessment if damage exceeds expectations (extending EVA to two hours within seven-hour suit capacity). Environmental challenges addressed: extreme temperature variation (\u00b1120\u00b0C to -150\u00b0C during sun/eclipse transition), 30-minute sunlight followed by 15-minute shadow period requiring helmet light usage. Communication protocol: UHF primary with Commander as CAPCOM, S-band ground backup, abort-on-comm-loss safety rule. Evening suit integrity checks scheduled (4.3 PSI, 30 minutes, zero leak tolerance). Crew demonstrated professional readiness balanced with healthy respect for spacewalk risks. Additional tasking: solar array panel 2B photography during return translation. Team confidence high with comprehensive preparation.",
