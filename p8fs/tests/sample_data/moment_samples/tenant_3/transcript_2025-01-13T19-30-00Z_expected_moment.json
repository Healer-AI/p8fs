  "name": "Client Dinner - Riverside Project Discussion",
  "content": "James meeting client Patricia over dinner to discuss Riverside project bid ahead of board meeting. Presented $12.8M bid with value engineering option to meet $12M budget cap through facade material substitution (fiber cement replacing aluminum panels, saving $600K). Patricia questioned performance implications; James assured 50-year warranty and proven longevity, noting only aesthetic difference. Timeline discussion: 18 months groundbreaking to occupancy with April start for fall next year tenant move-in. James emphasized honest communication about construction uncertainties (weather, supply chain, inspections) versus unrealistic promises. Patricia appreciated candor and company's on-time delivery track record. Agreed to recommend bid to board with Friday decision expected. Relationship-building through transparent business discussion.",
