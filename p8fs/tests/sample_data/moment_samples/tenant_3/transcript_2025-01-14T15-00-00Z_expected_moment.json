  "content": "James and CFO Karen reviewing Q4 financials ahead of board meeting. Revenue grew 18% YoY to $47.2M with margins compressed from 13.5% to 12.8% due to steel and lumber cost increases. Three legacy fixed-price contracts absorbing $400K in lost margin, completing Q1-Q2. Cash position strong at $3.2M with 40% credit line utilization and healthy 52-day payables. Identified collection issue: Westfield Properties 90 days overdue on $180K (retail plaza project). James committed to direct CEO contact for resolution. Positive outlook: $62M backlog for 2025, potential $12.8M Riverside addition. Strategic decision: invest in project manager and senior estimator hires to support growth trajectory.",
