  "content": "James leading bid review meeting with Sarah and David for $12M Riverside office complex project. Evaluated subcontractor bids: selected Miller Electric ($1.8M) over cheaper Apex based on proven track record and relationships. ClimaTech HVAC ($2.4M) chosen for reliability despite higher cost. Noted industry labor shortage limiting bid competition (Superior HVAC unavailable through Q3). Total hard costs calculated at $11.2M, with overhead and profit bringing bid to $12.8M - $800K over client's stated $12M budget. Strategized solution: submit full bid with value engineering alternatives (facade simplification) to meet budget target. Prioritized relationship value and quality over cost minimization.",
