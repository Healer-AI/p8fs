  "content": "James providing project readiness update to Patricia ahead of board meeting. Confirmed all subcontractors locked in (Miller Electric, ClimaTech HVAC) and ready to commit pending approval. Reaffirmed 18-month timeline with built-in buffer for weather and supply chain risks, addressing board concerns about market-wide delays. Referenced strong track record: eight consecutive projects delivered on-time or early. Patricia revealed James is top choice with board leaning heavily toward approval. Discussed value engineering: $12.8M base bid reducible to $12M target via aluminum-to-fiber-cement facade switch with no quality compromise (50-year warranty, same performance). Patricia endorsed VE option, appreciating $800K savings reallocation potential for interior finishes and landscaping where tenants notice. Call concluded with Patricia's commitment to recommend approval, expecting Friday afternoon decision.",
