# Personal Journal - Week of March 2024

## Monday, March 18, 2024

Woke up feeling anxious about the upcoming product launch. The team has been working hard, but I'm not sure we're ready. Sarah mentioned in our 1:1 that the backend performance issues are still unresolved. Need to schedule time with the engineering team this week.

**Goals for this week:**
- Finalize the marketing materials by Wednesday
- Complete the investor deck for the Series A meeting on Friday
- Start looking into that ML certification course everyone's been recommending

Met with Alex from Google for coffee. He's interested in collaborating on the open source project. This could be huge for my career growth.

Productive day! Finished the marketing copy and got positive feedback from the team. Jane from design is creating the final assets tomorrow.

**Concerns:**
- Still worried about the technical debt we're accumulating
- Not sure if the current team size is sustainable as we scale
- Financial runway is only 8 months - need to close this funding round

Had dinner with Mom. She's doing well after the surgery, but still needs help with groceries and doctor appointments. Added a recurring reminder to check in every Sunday.

**Personal goals:**
- Get back to running 3x per week (fell off during the busy season)
- Read at least 2 books this month (currently reading "Deep Work")
- Spend more quality time with Emma - she starts kindergarten next year!

## Wednesday, March 20, 2024

Tough day. The demo didn't go as planned - we hit that database timeout issue again. Tom is investigating but it might delay the launch by 2 weeks.

Meeting with investors tomorrow at 2 PM - Sequoia Capital offices downtown. Need to prepare:
- Updated financial projections
- User growth metrics
- Competitive landscape analysis
- Team expansion plans

Feeling overwhelmed. Maybe I should talk to David about bringing on a COO to help with operations. I'm spending too much time on admin tasks instead of product vision.

**Dreams/aspirations:**
- Want to build a company that makes a real difference in education tech
- Eventually start a foundation to support underrepresented founders
- Write a book about building startups the "right way"

Better day! The investor meeting went really well. They're interested and want to move forward with due diligence. Mark from Sequoia mentioned they see us as a strong player in the EdTech space.

**Action items:**
- Send financial data room access to Sequoia by EOD Friday
- Schedule follow-up calls with their portfolio companies next week
- Review term sheet with our lawyer Sarah Johnson

Tom fixed the database issue! It was a connection pooling problem. Launch back on track for March 30th.

Celebrated with the team over pizza. These are the moments that make the stress worth it.

## Friday, March 22, 2024

Wrapped up a solid week. Sent all the requested materials to Sequoia.

**Personal reflections:**
- Need to work on work-life balance - barely saw Emma this week
- The stress is affecting my sleep (woke up at 3 AM worrying about payroll)
- Should probably start therapy again, Dr. Martinez was really helpful last year

**People I'm grateful for:**
- Sarah (VP Eng) - always has my back when things get tough
- Jane (Design lead) - goes above and beyond on every project
- Alex - great mentor and sounding board
- Mom - for always being supportive even when she doesn't fully understand what I do

Weekend plans: Family time with Emma at the park, catch up on sleep, maybe start that ML course on Coursera.

**Long-term thinking:**
If this round closes, we can finally hire that senior backend engineer we desperately need. Also want to expand the sales team by Q3. The vision is becoming clearer - we could be the Salesforce of education within 5 years.

But first, let's nail this launch. One step at a time.
