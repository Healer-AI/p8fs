  Final standup of the sprint. The team has accomplished a tremendous amount this week:
  80% sprint completion with critical onboarding flow work done and ready for deployment.

  Sarah Chen facilitated. Key updates from the team:

  Mike Johnson (Tech Lead):
  - API rate limiting fix deployed and stable (Monday's blocker resolved)
  - Database migration 90% complete, finishing over weekend
  - Ready for 2pm staging deployment

  Alex Rodriguez (Backend Engineer):
  - Exponential backoff implementation performing excellently
  - Migration scripts tested and validated
  - Standing by for deployment support this afternoon

  Jamie Lee (Designer):
  - Onboarding flow final designs approved
  - User testing friction points documented for Kevin
  - Design system work progressing (separate project)

  Kevin Park (Frontend Engineer):
  - Onboarding flow implementation complete
  - Quick fixes from Thursday user research (email verification helper text, password strength
    indicator) implemented this morning - took 1.5 hours
  - Ready to deploy at 2pm

  Carlos Martinez (DevOps) joined briefly:
  - Staging environment fully configured
  - Deployment automation tested
  - Monitoring and alerts configured
  - Deployment window: 2pm-3pm this afternoon

  Sprint retrospective insights:
  - Monday's API blocker was handled well - quick resolution by Tuesday
  - Design → User Testing → Quick Iteration workflow proved effective
  - Cross-team collaboration (eng, design, research, DevOps) was excellent
  - Timeline pressure from Wednesday's CEO meeting helped focus priorities

  Weekend work:
  - Testing in staging environment (entire team on-call)
  - Database migration completion (Alex)
  - Production deployment preparation for Monday

  Energy in the room is high. Team knows this afternoon's deployment kicks off the final
  two weeks before launch. David (CEO) will be watching staging environment closely
  ahead of the November 28 investor demo.
