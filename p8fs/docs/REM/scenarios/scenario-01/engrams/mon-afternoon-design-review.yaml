  Design review session for the new onboarding flow that Jamie presented in this morning's standup.

  Jamie Lee (Designer) walked through the complete user journey for the new onboarding experience.
  The redesign focuses on reducing friction in the signup process and improving first-time user
  activation rates.

  Kevin Park (Frontend Engineer) asked clarifying questions about mobile responsiveness and
  animation timing. Jamie showed interactive prototypes demonstrating the flow on different
  screen sizes.

  Sarah Chen (Product Manager) suggested we implement A/B testing to validate the new design
  against the current flow. The team agreed to run a two-week test with 50/50 traffic split.

  Key decisions:
  - Approved designs with minor tweaks to button placement
  - A/B test strategy: 50/50 split for 2 weeks starting next Monday
  - Kevin to begin implementation tomorrow
  - Target completion: Friday this week for staging deployment

  This design is critical for the Q4 roadmap and November 30 launch timeline.
