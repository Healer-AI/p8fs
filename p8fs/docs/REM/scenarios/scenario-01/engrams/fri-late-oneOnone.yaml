  Regular 1-on-1 with Jamie Lee to discuss career growth and upcoming opportunities.
  This week's meeting had extra significance given Jamie's successful onboarding flow
  work and validation from user research.

  Sarah opened by recognizing Jamie's excellent work this week:
  - Onboarding flow designs validated by user testing (75% success rate, 48% faster)
  - Quick response to UX friction points identified Thursday
  - Strong collaboration with Kevin (Frontend) on implementation
  - Design thinking that balanced user needs with business timeline

  Career development discussion focused on design leadership:

  Jamie expressed interest in expanding beyond individual contributor role. Wants to
  lead design system work and mentor junior designers as team grows. Feels ready for
  more strategic influence on product direction.

  Sarah proposed plan:
  - Lead design system project post-launch (starting December)
  - Take ownership of design-engineering collaboration process
  - Mentor new designer joining in Q1 2025
  - Present at design team all-hands in January
  - Work toward Senior Designer promotion by Q2 2025

  Design system project scope:
  - Create comprehensive component library
  - Document design patterns and guidelines
  - Establish design-to-development workflow
  - Build reusable assets for marketing and product teams
  - Timeline: 3-month project starting December 1

  Jamie was energized by the opportunity. Sees design system work as perfect next
  challenge that leverages learnings from onboarding flow project (where component
  consistency was a challenge).

  Discussion also touched on work-life balance. Jamie appreciated the weekend break
  after intense week, acknowledged the on-call requirement for launch, but felt
  supported by the team.

  Meeting concluded with clear action items:
  - Sarah: Draft design system project charter by Nov 22
  - Jamie: Outline initial component library scope by Nov 25
  - Both: Check in after Thanksgiving to finalize plan
  - Target: Present design system proposal to David in early December

  This is exactly the kind of leadership development conversation that helps retain
  top talent. Jamie's success this week earned the opportunity.
