  User testing review session with Jamie and the UX research team to analyze results from
  yesterday's usability testing of the new onboarding flow.

  Jamie Lee (Designer) presented findings from 8 user testing sessions. The new flow performed
  well overall, with 6 out of 8 users completing signup successfully on first attempt. However,
  two friction points were identified that need addressing before launch.

  Key findings:
  - Overall completion rate: 75% (6/8 users)
  - Average signup time reduced from 4.5 minutes to 2.3 minutes (48% improvement)
  - Friction point 1: Email verification step confused 3 users
  - Friction point 2: Password requirements unclear for 2 users
  - Positive feedback on visual design and progressive disclosure approach

  Research team (led by Maria Rodriguez) recommended two quick fixes:
  1. Add inline helper text for email verification
  2. Show real-time password strength indicator

  Decision: Implement both fixes before Friday deployment. Kevin Park (Frontend) can complete
  both changes in ~2 hours. This validates Wednesday's design decisions while addressing
  real user feedback.

  This research validates the A/B testing strategy discussed Monday and confirms the onboarding
  flow is ready for launch with minor tweaks.
