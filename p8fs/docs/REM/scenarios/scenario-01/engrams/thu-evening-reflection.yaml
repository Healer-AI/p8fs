  End of Thursday, and I'm feeling really good about where we are.

  This morning's user research session was validating - 75% success rate and users completing
  signup 48% faster than the old flow. Jamie's design decisions from Monday were spot-on. The
  two friction points Maria identified (email verification and password requirements) are minor
  and Kevin can fix them quickly tomorrow.

  The DevOps sync this afternoon was reassuring. Carlos has staging ready, Mike confirmed the
  API blocker from Monday is fully resolved, and we have a solid deployment plan for Friday.
  The timeline is tight - only 10 days between production deployment and the investor demo -
  but it's manageable with the on-call rotation we planned.

  What struck me today is how everything connects:
  - Monday's design review led to Wednesday's user testing
  - Wednesday's CEO meeting set the hard deadline that drove today's DevOps planning
  - Monday's API blocker resolution cleared the path for tomorrow's deployment
  - The onboarding flow improvements we're shipping will be the centerpiece of the investor demo

  Team collaboration has been excellent all week. Mike and Alex solved the technical blocker,
  Jamie and Maria validated the design, Carlos has infrastructure ready. Everyone's pulling
  in the same direction toward the Nov 30 launch.

  Tomorrow is critical - onboarding flow goes to staging at 2pm. If testing goes well over the
  weekend, we deploy to production Monday and then have almost two weeks before the investor
  demo. David is counting on this being perfect.

  Feeling pressure but also confidence. This is what good product management looks like -
  coordinating technical work, design validation, business timelines, and keeping everyone
  aligned.
