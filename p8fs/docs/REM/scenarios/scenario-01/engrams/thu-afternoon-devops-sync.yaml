  Technical planning session with Mike Johnson (Tech Lead) and the DevOps team to ensure
  deployment infrastructure is ready for Friday's onboarding flow release and the upcoming
  November 30 launch.

  This sync connects Wednesday's CEO meeting (which confirmed Nov 30 launch and Nov 28 investor
  demo) with the technical reality of deployment readiness.

  Key discussion points:
  - Staging environment status: 95% ready, final configuration needed by Thursday EOD
  - CI/CD pipeline: Automated tests passing, deployment automation complete
  - Friday deployment plan: Deploy to staging at 2pm, production deployment Monday if tests pass
  - Investor demo environment: Separate staging instance needed by Nov 27

  Mike reported that the API rate limiting fix (from Monday's standup blocker) is deployed and
  performing well. Database migration is back on track and will complete this weekend.

  Carlos Martinez (DevOps Lead) outlined the deployment sequence:
  1. Thursday EOD: Finalize staging configuration
  2. Friday 2pm: Deploy onboarding flow to staging
  3. Friday 3-5pm: QA testing and validation
  4. Monday 10am: Production deployment (if staging tests pass)
  5. Nov 27: Investor demo environment ready

  Risk identified: Tight timeline between production deployment (Nov 18) and investor demo (Nov 28)
  leaves only 10 days for issue resolution. Team agreed to have on-call rotation Nov 25-30.
