  Deep dive with Mike and Alex on the API rate limiting solution. Mike walked through
  three potential approaches:

  1. Token bucket algorithm - most flexible, what Netflix uses
  2. Fixed window - simpler but less precise
  3. Sliding window - middle ground

  Alex has concerns about the token bucket complexity, but Mike made a good case that
  we'll need the flexibility as we scale. The key is getting the caching layer right -
  Redis should handle it well.

  We also discussed the broader API migration strategy. The rate limiting work needs
  to be done before we can safely migrate the user authentication endpoints. That's
  our critical path for the launch.

  Decision: Go with token bucket + Redis. Alex will prototype this week, we'll review
  on Thursday. This should resolve the blocker we identified in Monday's standup.
