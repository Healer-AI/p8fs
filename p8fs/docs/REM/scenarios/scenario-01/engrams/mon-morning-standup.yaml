  Daily standup with the engineering and design team to kick off the week.

  Sarah Chen facilitated the meeting. Mike Johnson (Tech Lead) reported that we're
  hitting rate limits on the third-party API, which is blocking the database migration
  work. This is becoming a critical blocker for our Q4 roadmap.

  Alex Rodriguez (Backend Engineer) suggested implementing exponential backoff and
  caching strategy to handle the rate limiting. Mike agreed this is the right approach
  and they'll pair on it this afternoon.

  Jamie Lee (Designer) presented the completed designs for the new onboarding flow.
  The team discussed A/B testing strategy for validating the new design. Kevin Park
  (Frontend) will start implementation once designs are approved.

  Key decisions:
  - Priority this sprint: Fix API rate limiting issue
  - Design review for onboarding flow scheduled for 2pm today
  - Database migration on hold until API issue resolved
