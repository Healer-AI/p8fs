  Quick standup update - team is making good progress.

  Alex: "Rate limiting implementation is going well. Got the token bucket algorithm
  working with Redis yesterday. Running load tests this morning. Should be ready for
  code review by tomorrow."

  Mike: "Nice work Alex. Once that's merged we can start the auth endpoint migration.
  That was our biggest blocker from Monday."

  Jamie: "I've been refining the onboarding designs based on Monday's review. Kevin
  and I synced yesterday - he's starting implementation today. Also working with
  marketing on messaging for the design sprint this afternoon."

  Kevin: "Frontend work for onboarding is straightforward. Should have a working
  prototype by Friday. Question though - are we A/B testing this right away or
  launching it first?"

  Sarah: "Good question. Let's discuss that in the design sprint. My gut says we should
  test, but let's see what marketing thinks about timing."

  Team feels energized. Rate limiting fix is happening faster than expected.
