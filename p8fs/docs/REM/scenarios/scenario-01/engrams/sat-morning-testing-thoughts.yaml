  Saturday morning, grabbing coffee and thinking about yesterday's deployment.

  The 2pm staging deployment went smoothly. Carlos and Mike had everything ready,
  Kevin's code deployed without issues, and by 3pm we had the new onboarding flow
  running in staging. That was satisfying to watch after the week's work.

  Yesterday's all-hands was energizing. Seeing David present the company vision and
  the whole team aligned on November 30 gave me confidence we can pull this off.
  The energy in the room when I presented the 48% signup time improvement - that
  was a proud moment.

  My 1-on-1 with Jamie afterwards was great too. She's ready for design leadership,
  and the design system project is perfect for her growth. It'll also solve the
  component consistency issues we ran into with the onboarding flow. Win-win.

  Today I need to review the test results from staging. Carlos set up automated
  test suite that's been running overnight. Alex is finishing the database migration
  work. Mike's coordinating the on-call team.

  The plan:
  - This morning: Review automated test results
  - This afternoon: Manual testing of the onboarding flow in staging
  - Look specifically at those two UX fixes Kevin implemented Friday morning
  - Document any issues for Monday production deployment decision

  If staging tests look good this weekend, we deploy to production Monday morning.
  That gives us almost two weeks before the November 28 investor demo. Feels
  achievable.

  The timeline is tight but manageable:
  - Monday Nov 18: Production deployment
  - Nov 18-27: Monitor, fix issues, gather metrics
  - Nov 27: Investor demo environment ready
  - Nov 28: Investor demo
  - Nov 30: Public launch

  I'm glad the API blocker from Monday got resolved quickly. If we'd still been
  dealing with that, we'd be in trouble. Alex and Mike really came through.

  Okay, going to make breakfast and then dive into those test results. Weekend
  work isn't ideal, but it's worth it for this launch. The team's commitment
  has been incredible all week.
