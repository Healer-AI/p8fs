  Quarterly all-hands meeting with the entire company. David (CEO) led the session,
  with updates from Sarah (Product), Mike (Engineering), and Marketing leadership.

  David opened with company vision and Q4 priorities:
  - Vitality app launch November 30 is the company's top priority
  - Investor demo November 28 will determine next funding round
  - Q4 revenue target: 40% growth from Q3
  - Team has grown from 32 to 42 people since Q3

  Sarah Chen presented product update:
  - New onboarding flow launches today to staging (2pm deployment happening concurrently)
  - User testing showed 48% reduction in signup time
  - A/B testing to begin Monday after production deployment
  - Onboarding improvements will be centerpiece of investor demo

  Mike Johnson provided engineering update:
  - API rate limiting issue from early week fully resolved
  - Infrastructure scaled to handle 10x current user load
  - Database migration completing this weekend
  - DevOps team has staging and production environments ready
  - On-call rotation Nov 25-30 to ensure launch stability

  Marketing team announced pre-launch campaign:
  - Email campaign begins Nov 25 (5 days before launch)
  - Social media push starts Nov 27
  - PR outreach to tech media scheduled for launch day
  - Target: 10,000 signups in first week

  The energy in the room was palpable. After Monday's technical blocker and Wednesday's

  Cross-functional collaboration highlighted:
  - Engineering resolved technical blockers quickly
