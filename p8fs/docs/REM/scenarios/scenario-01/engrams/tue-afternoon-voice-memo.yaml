  Hey, just had an idea during the drive home. What if we added a gamification layer
  to the health tracking features? Like, users could earn badges for consistency -
  7 day streak, 30 day streak, that kind of thing.

  I was thinking about the onboarding flow we reviewed yesterday, and how we really
  need to drive engagement in those first two weeks. The data shows most users who
  stick past 14 days become long-term active users.

  Could tie this into the A/B testing Jamie and I discussed. We could test gamified
  vs. non-gamified onboarding flows. Might help with retention metrics that marketing
  keeps asking about.

  Need to run this by Mike - probably too late for this sprint, but could be good
  for next sprint or the one after. Want to make sure we're not just adding features
  for the sake of it, but this feels like it could genuinely improve the user experience.

  Should also talk to the data team about what metrics we'd track to measure impact.
