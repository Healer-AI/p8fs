  Brief but critical sync with David (CEO) to confirm launch timeline and investor demo readiness.

  Sarah Chen (Product Manager) provided update on Vitality app launch progress. Onboarding flow
  is on track for completion by Friday, which gives us two weeks buffer before the November 30 launch.

  David asked specifically about investor demo readiness. The demo is scheduled for November 28,
  just two days before launch. Sarah confirmed that the staging environment will be ready and the
  onboarding flow improvements will be the main showcase feature.

  Key outcomes:
  - November 30 launch date officially confirmed
  - Investor demo scheduled for Nov 28 (2 days before launch)
  - Staging environment must be ready by Nov 27
  - Final Q4 metrics report needed by Monday Nov 18

  This meeting provides critical business context for the technical work happening this week.
