  Productive design sprint with Jamie and the marketing team. Focus was on finalizing
  the onboarding flow messaging and marketing integration.

  Jamie presented the updated designs - the tweaks from Monday's review look great.
  The flow is much cleaner now. Marketing loved the visual direction.

  Big discussion about the messaging. Marketing wants to emphasize "Start your health
  journey in 60 seconds" but we need to be careful about setting expectations. If
  setup actually takes 3 minutes, users will feel misled.

  Compromised on "Get started in minutes" - truthful but still compelling. Jamie will
  update the copy in the designs.

  Also discussed the A/B testing question Kevin raised this morning. Marketing team
  is nervous about testing - they want to launch with the best version. I pushed back
  and explained that testing IS how we find the best version. Eventually got buy-in
  to test two variations:
  - Version A: Progress bar showing steps
  - Version B: Single-page flow

  We'll measure completion rate and time-to-first-value. Marketing will track
  acquisition costs by variation.

  Jamie seemed energized by the collaboration with marketing. Good cross-team work.
