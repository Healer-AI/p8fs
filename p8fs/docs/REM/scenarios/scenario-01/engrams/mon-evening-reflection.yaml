  Feeling pretty good about today. The sprint planning went smoothly - Mike and the team
  are aligned on priorities. The API rate limiting issue that's been plaguing us needs
  to be fixed this sprint, and everyone agrees that's the right call.

  The design review with Jamie this afternoon was productive. The new onboarding flow
  looks really clean. I'm a bit concerned about the A/B testing timeline - we need to
  get this right before launch, but we're cutting it close. Kevin seemed confident about
  the implementation though.

  Q4 is going to be intense. The roadmap feels ambitious but achievable if we stay
  focused. Need to keep the team energized and make sure we don't burn out.

  Tomorrow: Deep dive with Mike and Alex on the API architecture. Want to make sure
  the rate limiting solution is solid before we commit.
