      Met with Sarah and Mike to discuss Project Alpha. Key goals: migrate database
      to TiDB, improve API performance by 50%, complete by Q1. Sarah will lead backend,
      Mike handles DevOps. Discussed technical approach and timeline.

      Technical specification for migrating from PostgreSQL to TiDB. Architecture:
      dual-write phase for 2 weeks, validation phase 1 week, read migration 2 weeks.
      Key challenges: vector index migration, JSONB to JSON conversion, query
      performance tuning. Team: Sarah Chen (backend), Mike Johnson (infrastructure).

      Quick standup update. Working on TiDB migration scripts today. Sarah is
      finishing the dual-write implementation. Mike set up the TiDB staging cluster.
      Blocked on getting production credentials. Need to sync with Emily about timeline.

      Reviewed Sarah's database migration code. Excellent work on the dual-write
      pattern. Left comments about error handling in the TiDB connector. Suggested
      adding retry logic for transient failures. Mike approved the infrastructure
      changes. Ready to merge after addressing comments.

      Great progress on Project Alpha this week. Sarah completed dual-write
      implementation, Mike deployed TiDB to staging. On track for Q1 delivery.
      Next week: start validation phase, performance testing. Emily confirmed
      budget approved for production cluster.

      Proposal for API performance improvements. Current bottlenecks: N+1 queries,
      lack of caching, inefficient JSON serialization. Solutions: implement query
      batching, add Redis caching layer, use protobuf for internal services.
      Expected 50-70% performance improvement. Needs review from Sarah and
      architecture team.

      Ran performance tests on TiDB migration. Results look good! Query latency
      down 30%, write throughput up 40%. Sarah's optimization work paid off.
      Mike identified one issue with connection pooling that we need to fix.
      Overall very promising. Team celebrating with lunch tomorrow.
